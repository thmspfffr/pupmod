### Neuromodulation of large-scale cortical correlations

## Contains code for collaborative project with Gustavo Deco, March-June 2016. 

- Computes orthogonalized amplitude envelope correlations across a range of (log-spaced) carrier frequencies (up to 128 Hz) in source space
(using beamforming/LCMV): pupmod_src_powcorr.m

- Contains code to simulate two Wilson-Cowan nodes (each tuned to the Hopf bifurcation) and the correlations between the two nodes

- Contains code to simulate the dynamics of the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation ("Hopf model"): foolingaroundwithhopf.m
